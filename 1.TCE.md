# Deploy TCE project to TIBCO Cloud
The TCE project for this workshop is a simple one that implements a decision table for airline travelers who are experiencing delayed flights.  The project has already been built using the TIBCO Cloud Events Studio IDE, and now we simply want to deploy the project to our TIBCO Cloud.  To do this, we'll be using the TIBCO Cloud Events Command Line Interface, tce-cli.  

Open the TIBCO Cloud Events CLI tool:
```bash
~/environment $ tce-cli
  _____ ___ ____   ____ ___     ____ _                 _   _____                 _          ____ _     ___ 
 |_   _|_ _| __ ) / ___/ _ \   / ___| | ___  _   _  __| | | ____|_   _____ _ __ | |_ ___   / ___| |   |_ _|
