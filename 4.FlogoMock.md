### Service Mesh
Now that we have the Flogo mack app running within our organization we have the option of making the services private to the Org and access then via the Service Mesh.

1)  Open the **K2Cloud_Backend** app
2)  In the App details area you should see the **Public** icon. This tells you that the API's are available to anyone.

On the Update panel click **Update**.

5)  Navigate back to the **Itineraries** app
6)  Open the **V1Itineraries_reservationid_GET** flow
7)  For each of the REST Invoke calls do the following:
    Set **Discover services from TIBCO Cloud Mesh** to **True**
    ![Browse](images/Extra6.png "Browse")
    Click **Browse** 
    Find the Backend app and click the right arrowhead to expand the services
    ![Select](images/Extra7.png "Select")
    Find the required service path and method. Click **Select**
