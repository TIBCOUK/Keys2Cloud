# API Implementation and Reuse

## Overview
In this hands-on lab you will extend itineraries API implementation by reusing aircrafts API.  The current itineraries API responds with reservation, passenger, flight and status details.  We want to also include aircraft details.  

### Get Started

Start by signing into TIBCO Cloud and opening API Specs.  There are many ways to navigate to API Spec but letâ€™s start with this.

1)	Start at Welcome to your TIBCO Cloud.
2)	Select Integration.
3)	Select Flogo.

### Import Application
We are going to use a prebuilt application for that hands-on lab and extend it by reusing flights API. 

1)	Select Create.
2)	Give your new app a name, v1_itineraries_todo and select create.
